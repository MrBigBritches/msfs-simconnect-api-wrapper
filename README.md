# msfs-simconnect-api-wrapper

A JavaScripty wrapper around EvenAR's excellent [node-simconnect](https://github.com/EvenAR/node-simconnect/) with a simplified API.

See [test.js](./test.js) for the basics, which you can run (with MSFS open and sitting on the apron with a plane =) using `npm test`.

This is still a work in progress, although it does wrap (almost) all the Aircraft simvars (845) as well as all Camera simvars (35) at the moment.
